<h1>GenX – Generative AI Chatbot</h1>

<h4>GenX is a simple yet powerful Generative AI chatbot built with Python that connects to the Google Gemini API. It enables natural conversations with an AI assistant directly from the terminal.</h4>

Designed as a lightweight project for learning and experimentation, GenX makes it easy to understand how modern AI models can be integrated into real-world applications.

<h2>Features</h2>

Zero-shot prompting – responds intelligently to any input.

Powered by Google Gemini API for advanced text generation.

Secure credential handling using .env files.

Simple CLI interface – chat instantly from your terminal.

Extensible codebase – can be upgraded to a full web or desktop app.

<h2>Project Vision</h2>

GenX is more than just a chatbot — it’s a learning project to explore Generative AI capabilities.

<h5>The long-term goal is to:</h5>

Build a multi-platform chatbot (terminal, web, mobile).

Experiment with prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, role prompts).

Support conversation history, context retention, and persistence.

Deploy GenX as a public-facing AI assistant that anyone can try.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Users store their Gemini API credentials inside a .env file.
The chatbot script reads these credentials securely.
GenX connects to the Gemini API and sends user queries.
The API responds with AI-generated replies in real time.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

Python 3.x – Core programming language.
